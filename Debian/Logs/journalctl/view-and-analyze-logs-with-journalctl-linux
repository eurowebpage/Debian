View All Log Messages
To view all journald logs, simply run the journalctl command without any arguments:

sudo journalctl

If you want to change the order in which the system outputs the logs, i.e. show the latest one first, you can use the -r flag with the command. The -r flag stands for Reverse.
sudo journalctl -r

--------------------
View Kernel journald Logs
Kernel logs are very important on Linux because they contain information related to your system from the time it boots up. To view kernel logs only, specify the -k flag with the journalctl command:

sudo journalctl -k
--------------------
Filter journald Logs by a Specific Program
You can also view logs related to a specific program or service using journalctl. For example, to view logs associated with the cron service, run the command below:

sudo journalctl -u cron
--------------------
View Log Messages in Real-Time
Sometimes you might want to view the logs in real-time as they are being logged. For that, issue the following command:

sudo journalctl -f
--------------------
Get Log Messages by Date
You can use journalctl to filter and analyze the logs using a timestamp. For example, to display the logs from yesterday until now:


sudo journalctl --since=yesterday
You can be more specific by using a detailed "since" and "until" timestamp, as follows:

sudo journalctl --since="2021-07-17 12:00:00" --until="2021-07-17 15:00:00"
Journalctl will only display the log messages for the specified period.
--------------------
View Log Messages by UID or PID
You can also filter journald logs using the user ID (UID) or the process ID (PID). The basic syntax is:

sudo journalctl _UID=0
...where 0 is the UID for the root account. You can also replace UID in the aforementioned command with either PID or GID (group ID).
--------------------
Formatting the journalctl Output
To view journalctl logs using a specific output format, you should use the journalctl -o command followed by your preferred format. For example, to display the logs in a pretty JSON format, run the command below:

sudo journalctl -o json-pretty
